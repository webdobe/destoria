              <p {...s.paragraph}>Destoria may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business
                partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique
                personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred
                to the third party. Destoria may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical
                analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.
                All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide
                these services to Destoria, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of
                your information.</p>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>Destoria may disclose your personal information, without notice, if required
                to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to
                the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Destoria or the site; (b) protect
                and defend the rights or property of Destoria; and/or (c) act under exigent circumstances to
                protect the personal safety of users of Destoria, or the public.</p>

              <strong>Tracking User Behavior</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>Destoria may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within
                Destoria, in order to determine what Destoria services are the most popular. This data is
                used to deliver customized content and advertising within Destoria to customers whose
                behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>

              <strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically
                collected by Destoria. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain
                names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the
                operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general
                statistics regarding use of the Destoria website.</p>

              <strong>Use of Cookies</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>The Destoria website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
                experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.
                Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are
                uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
                the cookie to you.</p>

              <p {...s.paragraph}>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
                to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
                to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Destoria pages, or register with Destoria
                site or services, a cookie helps Destoria to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
                This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
                shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Destoria website, the information
                you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Destoria features that
                you customized.</p>

              <p {...s.paragraph}>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
                automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline
                cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
                experience the interactive features of the Destoria services or websites you visit.</p>

              <strong>Links</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not
                responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our
                users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other
                site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

              <strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>Destoria secures your personal information from unauthorized access,
                use, or disclosure. Destoria uses the following methods for this purpose:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>SSL Protocol</li>
              </ul>

              <p {...s.paragraph}>When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted
                to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the
                Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

              <p {...s.paragraph}>We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against
                unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no
                data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be
                100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you
                acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the
                Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of
                any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site
                cannot be guaranteed.</p>

              <strong>Right to Deletion</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>Subject to certain exceptions set out below, on receipt of a verifiable request from you, we will:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Delete your personal information from our records; and</li>
                <li>Direct any service providers to delete your personal information from their records.</li>
              </ul>

              <p {...s.paragraph}>Please note that we may not be able to comply with requests to delete
                your personal information if it is necessary to:</p>

              <ul>

                  anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you,
                  or otherwise perform a contract between you and us;</li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent,

                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research
                  in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws,
                  when our deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously
                  impair the achievement of such research, provided we have obtained your informed consent;</li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations
                  based on your relationship with us;</li>
                <li>Comply with an existing legal obligation; or</li>
                <li>Otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is
