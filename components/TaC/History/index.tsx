              <strong>Arbitration</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of
                or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract,
                tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute
                shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
                Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration
                Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location
                mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment
                may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or
                equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and
                Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
                attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to
                these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions,
                whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms
                and Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation
                and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability
                of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration
                provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

              <strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>
              <p {...s.paragraph}>Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis;
                class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted.
                THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL
                CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR
                REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST
                THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Destoria agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
                a representative or class proceeding.</p>

                ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
                DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE,
                DATA OR PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF
                THE SITE, WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR RELATED SERVICES, THE PROVISION
                OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES

                THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE,
                EVEN IF DESTORIA OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.
                BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF
                YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SITE, OR WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS OF USE,
                YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE.</p>

              <strong>Termination/Access Restriction</strong>

                and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum
                extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California
                and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in California in
                all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized
                in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including,
                without limitation, this section.</p>

              <p {...s.paragraph}>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
                between you and Destoria as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. Destoria's
                performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing
                contained in this agreement is in derogation of Destoria's right to comply with governmental,
                court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or
                information provided to or gathered by Destoria with respect to such use. If any part of
                this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law
                including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set
                forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a
                valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision
                and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.</p>

              <p {...s.paragraph}>Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the

                communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and
                Destoria with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice
                given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based
                upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions
                as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
                It is the express wish to the parties that this agreement and all related documents be
                written in English.</p>
